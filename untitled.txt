Handling Missing Data: Missing data can be handled by techniques such as:

Removing rows or columns with missing values.
Imputing missing values using statistical measures like mean, median, or mode.
Using advanced imputation methods like regression imputation or k-nearest neighbors.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicated data can be identified and removed to ensure data integrity.

Data Transformation: Transformation techniques are used to modify the data to meet specific requirements, such as:

Scaling or normalization: Scaling numeric data to a specific range (e.g., 0-1) or normalizing it to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Log transformation: Taking the logarithm of variables to handle skewness or reduce the impact of outliers.
Encoding categorical variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Handling Outliers: Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. They can be handled by techniques such as:

Identifying and removing outliers based on statistical measures like z-scores or interquartile range (IQR).
Winsorization: Capping or flooring extreme values to a certain percentile.
Data Formatting: Formatting involves standardizing the format of data to ensure consistency, such as:

Converting data types: Ensuring appropriate data types for variables (e.g., converting strings to integers or floats).
Handling inconsistent capitalization or naming conventions.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data that might improve model performance or capture relevant information.

Data Validation: Checking data for inconsistencies, errors, or logical issues to ensure its quality and accuracy.

There are various libraries and tools available in different programming languages to assist with data cleaning, such as Python's Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, or R's dplyr and tidyr packages. These tools provide functions and methods to perform various cleaning operations efficiently.
