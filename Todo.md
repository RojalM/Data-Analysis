cleaning - predicting - Data Transformation - Handling Outliers - usage some AI tech
TODO: 
  - Data Transformation :
     - Scaling or normalization
     - Log transformation
     - Encoding categorical variables
  - Handling Outliers
  - Data Formatting
  - Data Validation
  - Analyze cleaned data for:
      - insights
      - patterns
      - characteristics using statistics, visualization, and exploratory techniques
  - Feature engineering enhances data's predictive power by creating new or transformed features, such as scaling and encoding variables or creating interaction and derived features.
  - Data Visualization
  - Using statistical methods to analyze data, including hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis, and ANOVA.
  - Machine Learning Modeling: Using algorithms to predict and classify data after cleaning. Choose algorithms, split data, train models, adjust parameters, and evaluate performance.
  
  - further more will be implemeted...
