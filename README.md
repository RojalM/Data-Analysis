# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for performing data analysis and machine learning tasks. It covers various steps in the data analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and modeling.

## Work

- Data Transformation:
  - Scaling or normalization
  - Log transformation
  - Encoding categorical variables

- Handling Outliers

- Data Formatting

- Data Validation

- Analyze cleaned data for:
  - Insights
  - Patterns
  - Characteristics using statistics, visualization, and exploratory techniques

- Feature Engineering:
  - Enhances data's predictive power by creating new or transformed features
  - Examples: Scaling and encoding variables, creating interaction and derived features

- Data Visualization

- Statistical Analysis:
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Correlation and regression analysis
  - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

- Machine Learning Modeling:
  - Choose algorithms
  - Split data
  - Train models
  - Adjust parameters
  - Evaluate performance

## Further Work

- Implement additional data analysis techniques
- Explore advanced machine learning algorithms
- Improve documentation and code readability
- Enhance visualization techniques
- Refactor code for better modularity and reusability
